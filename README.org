#+TITLE: Talks monorepo

Over the last few years I've given many talks and demos at community events, it's one of the things I really love to do. To support these talks and demo's I've historically created separate repositories for each which ends up creating a bit of unmaintained clutter in github so moving forward I will be using this monorepo to keep things together.

Additionally I want to keep and track a bit more of an overview for the talks I've given with things like links to recordings so this repository will hopefully make it easier for me to do that.

Whether you attended one of my talks or just stumbled upon this repository, I hope that you will find these materials informative and helpful in your own projects.
