Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security can be easily integrated into an existing GitHub actions pipeline through the existing Stackrox suite of [[https://github.com/marketplace?query=stackrox][open source actions]].

* Configure rhacs github oidc auth

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) provides the ability to configure short-lived access to the user interface and API calls.

You can configure this by exchanging OpenID Connect (OIDC) identity tokens for a RHACS-issued token.

We recommend this especially for Continuous Integration (CI) usage, where short-lived access is preferable over long-lived API tokens.

* Create github actions pipeline


An example pipeline would look like:

#+begin_src yaml

#+end_src
